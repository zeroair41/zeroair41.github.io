RSA encryption and digital signatures are two crucial components that help ensure both security and authenticity. Today, weâ€™ll dive into how RSA signatures work and demonstrate how to implement them in Python.\nWeâ€™ll cover:\nGenerating public and private keys Encrypting a message for secure communication Signing a message for authenticity Verifying the signature to confirm its source Letâ€™s jump in!\nA Brief Overview of RSA: # RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm used for both encryption and signing. It relies on a public-private key pair:\nThe public key is used for encrypting data and verifying signatures. It can be shared openly. The private key is used for decrypting data and creating signatures. It must be kept secure. The process of signing allows you to authenticate the origin of a message. Essentially, by signing a message, youâ€™re using your private key to generate a unique signature, which anyone with your public key can verify.\nStep 1: Generating RSA Keys: # To follow along, you need RSA keys. For this example, letâ€™s generate our own keys.\nThe process of key generation involves:\nSelecting two large prime numbers, p and q. Calculating N=pÃ—q. Calculating Ï•(N)=(pâˆ’1)Ã—(qâˆ’1) Selecting a public exponent e, which is typically 65537. Determining the private key d, which is the modular inverse of e modulo Ï•(N). Hereâ€™s the code:\n# Step 1: Select two large prime numbers, p and q p = getPrime(512) # 512-bit prime for example purposes q = getPrime(512) # Step 2: Calculate N = p * q N = p * q # Step 3: Calculate Ï•(N) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) phi_N = (p - 1) * (q - 1) # Step 4: Select a public exponent e e = 65537 # Commonly used value for e # Step 5: Calculate the private key d, which is the modular inverse of e modulo Ï•(N) d = pow(e, -1, phi_N) # Printing the keys print(\u0026#34;Public Key (N, e):\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;N = {N}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;e = {e}\u0026#34;) print(\u0026#34;\\nPrivate Key (N, d):\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;N = {N}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;d = {d}\u0026#34;) This setup ensures that you have both an encryption key (public key) and a decryption key (private key).\nLetâ€™s now put our keys to use!\nStep 2: Signing and Encrypting the Message: # Hereâ€™s the scenario:\nYou, the sender, will sign the message using your private key. You will then encrypt the signed message using your friendâ€™s public key so only they can read it. Hereâ€™s the code:\nfrom hashlib import sha256 # Importing the SHA-256 hashing algorithm # Own RSA keys (private and public) own_decryption_key = 557039820478963630987824353291578599136059185493036744361619995981604349033509275187006036413348457353229065590145649264317981320495265828225691250227436627950380140312691345995567216885209096438411775703891209812905070006859405226963760362777288605320416723513198803620224752470085103470630892040803115073 # Private key own_public_key = 60341683825999734684378586184578820911702331966375453083020644093630420202659665070960024146151434462080286399308058538571252135208757415842028309861414088754201429208593194406919737052886050899503374401255680985303985305673539849312801504843108333165972740331833871923484768429390468329882756377536602788349 # Public key modulus own_public_key_exponent = 65537 # Public key exponent, commonly chosen as 65537 for efficiency # Friend\u0026#39;s public RSA key friend_public_key_exponent = 65537 # Friend\u0026#39;s public key exponent friend_public_key = 124635880425463236816405829018856743683640397655827026728571600981597987344870783920887353388732835598504050402809812368672914825753659518155588470385920050713463078544219562695491794678584987346544532871623557706254621928742810050937220512991910307218321820634633967793468886068548140689985949102802348388297 # Friend\u0026#39;s public key modulus # Message that needs to be signed and encrypted message = b\u0026#39;Hello are you ready for plan?\u0026#39; # The message in bytes format message_hash = sha256(message).digest() # Creating a hash of the message using SHA-256 for signing # Signing the message with the private key # Signature is created by encrypting the hash of the message with your private key signature = pow(bytes_to_long(message_hash), own_decryption_key, own_public_key) # Encrypting the message using friend\u0026#39;s public key # Message is encrypted using the friend\u0026#39;s public key, ensuring only they can decrypt it cipher = pow(bytes_to_long(message), friend_public_key_exponent, friend_public_key) # Print the results: the encrypted message and the signature print(f\u0026#39;Message (Encrypted): {cipher}\\nSignature: {signature}\u0026#39;) Explanation: # Hashing the Message: The message is hashed using SHA-256, creating a fixed-length representation. Creating the Signature: The message hash is then signed using the senderâ€™s private key. Encrypting the Message: To ensure that only the intended recipient can read it, the message is encrypted with the recipientâ€™s public key. Step 3: Receiving and Verifying the Message: # In this step, the recipient needs to do two things:\nDecrypt the Encrypted Message: Use their private key to recover the original plaintext. Verify the Signature: Confirm that the message came from the original sender by validating the signature against the message.

Conclusion # By signing a message with your private key, you ensure its authenticity, and by encrypting it with the recipientâ€™s public key, you guarantee confidentiality. RSA provides a secure way to accomplish both goals.\nThe code above demonstrates how to sign, encrypt, verify, and decrypt using RSA keys â€” all in Python! Whether youâ€™re sharing plans with friends or exploring cryptography, RSA is a powerful tool for secure communication.\nFeel free to experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
